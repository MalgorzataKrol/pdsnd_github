### Explore US Bikeshare Data


### Description
In this project I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. There are some interesting questions about it answered using computing descriptive statistics and also some charts. There is a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
Files used for this project can be downloaded from here: [bikeshare-2](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/March/5aab379c_bikeshare-2/bikeshare-2.zip). There are 3 csv files there for each of 3 locations. The source data can be found here:
- [Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
- [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
- [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)

There was some data wrangling computed on the source data.

### Software

To run the project:
- You should have Python 3, NumPy, pandas and matplotlib installed
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
